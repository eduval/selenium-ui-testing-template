## Introduction to Automation Testing with Selenium

This repository introduces **automation testing** in the context of **DevOps**, focusing on real-world testing using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Node.js**.

Automation testing plays a key role in DevOps pipelines to ensure the reliability and quality of software deployments through CI/CD. Selenium enables automated UI tests that simulate user interactions and validate outcomes programmatically.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (`chromedriver` npm package)

### 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduval/selenium-ui-testing-template
cd selenium-ui-testing-template
npm install
```

2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run a Local Web Server (Optional)
You can serve the frontend file with a simple server:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve app
```

4. Run Selenium Tests
Run any test file individually with:
```bash
node tests/test1_basic_registration.js
```

Or for the second test:
```bash
node tests/test2_missing_firstname.js
```

## 🧪 Tests Included

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `test1_basic_registration.js` | Simulates a complete team registration process and validates correct behavior |
| `test2_missing_firstname.js` | Checks form validation by omitting required input and ensuring no member is added |

## ✨ Instructor Notes

This repository serves both as:
1. A learning tool
2. A template for students to expand on

### Potential expansions:
- Integrate into CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)
- Add more test scenarios (invalid emails, form resets)
- Use assertion libraries (Chai/Mocha) for formal test outcomes
